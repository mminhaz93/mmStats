### Getting started

- Create a new Gatsby site using the moStats starter: `gatsby new blog https://github.com/mminhaz93/moStats`
- Edit configuration variables in `.env.development` file

- `ESLint` and `Stylelint` to enforce code style. Run `npm run lint:scripts` for `.js|.jsx` and `npm run lint:styles` for `.css|.scss` files.
- Pre-commit hooks with `husky` and `lint-staged`
- Useful SCSS helpers `_mixins` and `_vars` see all in `./src/styles`
- `redux` and `redux-devtools` implimented and configured to work well in `development` mode and `production`. The store is hot reloadable ;)
- Aliases for all folders (components, styles, store etc.) see all available aliases in `./gatsby-config.js`
- `antd` is added and configured to work well as an UI framework (css normalization is not need, antd has own)
- All folders in `./src` have own README.md file with a little documentation and usage guide
- `Helmet` implimented and configured with `gatsby-plugin-react-helmet` see an example in `./src/layouts/MainLayout.js`
- Configured `tailwindcss` a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

### When ready to build for production
